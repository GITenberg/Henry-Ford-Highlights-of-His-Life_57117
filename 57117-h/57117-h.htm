<p class="tb">Henry Ford spent his early life on a farm. He was
born in a small frame house that stood in a grove
a few miles from Detroit, near the River Rouge. On each
side of the river were the farms of people who had come to
the Middle West to get land of their own. Henry&rsquo;s father,
William Ford, was one of these early settlers.</p>
<p>The elder Ford came to America from Ireland in
1847, the year of the great potato famine in that country.
He made his way to southern Michigan where he found
work. At first, he labored on the railroad and then at the
arsenal in Dearbornville. Later, he was a &ldquo;hired hand&rdquo; on
the farm of Patrick O&rsquo;Hern in Springwells Township.
Here William Ford settled down. He purchased forty
acres of land, and with his employer, Patrick O&rsquo;Hern,
built a farmhouse. In 1861 he married Mary Litogot, the
foster daughter of O&rsquo;Hern.</p>
<p>Henry Ford, the first son of Mary and William, was
born in 1863. Soon there were brothers and sisters. Their
life on the farm was a round of doing chores, working in
the fields, and taking trips to town. In the winter, the
children went to the one-room school over at the &ldquo;Scotch
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Ford might well have remained on the farm
and followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps. The soil around
Dearborn was fertile, and the products of the land found
a good market in nearby Detroit, a busy lake port.
Although farming meant hard work and long hours, it
was an honorable trade. William Ford was not rich, but
neither was he poor. He held a position of respect in the
community.</p>
<p>But Henry Ford had other ideas. He wanted to have
something to do with machinery. He was interested in
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the tools of the farm rather than in the farm itself. He
also tinkered with watches; at the age of thirteen he was
repairing the timepieces of his friends. It was a real thrill
for him when Fred Reden, a neighbor, brought the first
portable steam engine to Dearborn. Henry was permitted
to fire its boiler. On the trips to town with his father, he
saw other machines, road engines, carding mills, and
grist mills.</p>
<p>When Henry finished school at the age of sixteen, he
did what thousands of other farmers&rsquo; sons were doing&mdash;he
left for the city.</p>
<p>Detroit was a bustling town of one hundred thousand
people. It was a commercial center for the Great Lakes
shipping trade, and it was also an industrial center. It was
to the shops and factories of Detroit that Henry Ford
came to learn a trade.</p>
<p>His first job, at the Michigan Car Works, lasted only
six days, but he soon found another one at the machine
shop of James Flowers and Bros., where he became a
machinist&rsquo;s apprentice. In this shop he learned about
engines, and about the tools and machines that made
parts for other machines. At night he repaired watches in
the jewelry shop of James Magill. A few months later, he
left the Flowers&rsquo; shop to work at the Dry Dock Engine
Company where he had greater opportunity to learn
about steam engines. When his apprenticeship was over,
he became Henry Ford, the machinist.</p>
<p>Instead of continuing to work at his trade in the
shops of Detroit, he went back to Dearborn. William Ford
lent his son eighty acres of timbered land, and Henry
Ford set up a saw mill. During the harvesting season, he
operated an engine for a group of threshers. He also found
time to travel about southern Michigan repairing Westinghouse
portable steam engines.</p>
<p>Henry Ford was also continuing his education. For
several months he attended a business college in Detroit,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
all the while tinkering with machines and learning still
more about tools. He had an opportunity to repair, and
thus become familiar with, a &ldquo;gas engine&rdquo; at an iron works
in Detroit. As an apprentice, he had read about such an
engine, invented by a German named Otto, which received
its power from an explosion inside the cylinder. Several
Americans were also thinking about this &ldquo;internal combustion&rdquo;
engine.</p>
<p>In 1888 he married Clara Bryant, whose father owned
a farm near the Ford homestead in Dearborn. After their
marriage, the young couple built a &ldquo;square&rdquo; house nearby,
where they lived for nearly three years. During this time,
Henry farmed as well as repaired and operated steam
engines.</p>
<p>In 1891, Henry Ford ended his days on the farm
by moving back to Detroit, where he was employed by
the Edison Illuminating Company, one of several companies
that furnished electricity to the city. Detroit was
changing&mdash;in the days of his apprenticeship, there had
been no electric lights for homes and streets and shops.
Henry&rsquo;s new job was to keep the steam engines running
at the Willis Avenue power station.</p>
<p>The year 1893 was a good year for Henry Ford, in
spite of the fact that it was a hard year of panic for many
other people. At the World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago that summer,
he was able to add to his knowledge of gas engines and
&ldquo;horseless carriages.&rdquo; Late in the year, his son Edsel was
born. Shortly after this, his pay was raised and he was
transferred to the main plant of the Illuminating Company.
To be nearer his new job, the Ford family moved
to 58 Bagley Avenue in Detroit. In the back yard of the
new home was a brick shed; here Henry set up his tools
and continued his tinkering with gas engines.</p>
<p>His first experiment was not long in the making.
With a piece of gas pipe, an old wheel, some wire, and
other scraps of metal assembled on a long board fastened
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
to the kitchen sink in the Ford home, he made his first
model gas engine. Although it sputtered and jumped, it
worked.</p>
<p>During the years that Henry Ford worked on his
homemade engines, other men were also experimenting
with gas engines, and they were just as determined as he
was to make them operate successfully. The fair in
Chicago had aroused the curiosity of many people, and
the newspapers began to carry stories about &ldquo;horseless
carriages.&rdquo; From France came word of the exploits of
Daimler and Benz with their &ldquo;road wagons,&rdquo; and in 1895,
New Yorkers saw three Benz &ldquo;horseless wagons.&rdquo; Henry
Ford traveled East to see them. Late in the same year,
the Chicago <i>Times-Herald</i> announced that it would give
a $5,000 prize to the winner of a race between these
new contraptions. Only four cars were ready at race time,
and only two got away from the starting line&mdash;a Duryea
and a Benz. The Benz won. One of Henry Ford&rsquo;s friends,
Charles B. King of Detroit, was an umpire of the race.
Back in Detroit, the two friends probably discussed the
merits of the cars that King had seen in Chicago. At any
rate, King gave Ford some intake valves for his engines.</p>
<p>Henry Ford continued to add to his knowledge of
gas engines. Soon after the race in Chicago, the <i>American
Machinist</i> magazine told of an engine invented by E. J.
Pennington which, in a day when most gas engines were
bulky and heavy, was light and compact. This idea
appealed to Ford, and his work took a new turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">The First <i>Ford</i> Takes to the Road</span></h2>
<p>By the spring of 1896, he was ready to make a trial
run with his own horseless carriage. First he had to tear
out part of the brick wall of his shed in order to get his
machine into the alley. Once in the open, the engine was
started, and the car bumped down the cobblestone street
and continued successfully on its first short run around
the block. A few weeks later, he drove it out to the homestead
in Dearborn. His father was not impressed with the
contraption.</p>
<p>These first tests meant more labor; hours of changing,
adjusting, and repairing were ahead. During the day,
Ford was the chief engineer of the Illuminating Company,
but in his spare time, he was Ford the experimenter.</p>
<p>The signs of the times were encouraging. The great
inventor, Thomas Edison, announced in the newspapers
that the horse was doomed. Up in Lansing, R. E. Olds
produced his first Oldsmobile. Alexander Winton of Cleveland
drove his auto from Cleveland to New York, making
what was called a &ldquo;reliability&rdquo; run. William K. Vanderbilt
bought a car to race. All over the nation, people began to
read and hear about the marvels of the new invention, of
the men who were building cars, and of the races they
held at fairgrounds and parks.</p>
<p>A new field was thus opened up for sportsmen. In
Detroit, William H. Murphy, a prominent citizen, heard
of Henry Ford&rsquo;s car. Murphy and his friends saw an
opportunity to get into the racing car business; they
formed a company, called the Detroit Automobile Company,
with Henry Ford as its chief engineer. At last he
could leave the Illuminating Company and devote all of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
his time to automobiles. It was a bold move for a man
with a family to give up a good job. Some of his friends
and relatives told each other that he should have stayed
where he was.</p>
<p>The original investment of Murphy and his friends
was not enough. Improvements and changes in the model
were made. Even though $68,000 was invested in the
company, the hoped for production of many cars never
materialized, and in January, 1901, Henry Ford left the
Detroit Automobile Company.</p>
<p>Henry Ford went to work on a racer which he hoped
would bring him new opportunities to manufacture automobiles.
His chance came in 1901. It was announced in
Detroit that Alexander Winton would race his world
champion car, &ldquo;The Bullet,&rdquo; at the Grosse Pointe race
track, a few miles from the city; Henry Ford challenged
the champion.</p>
<p>When the day of the race arrived, stores and shops
closed, and a parade of sixty-eight cars moved out to
Grosse Pointe. Three cars lined up for the ten-mile race,
but only Winton and Ford got away. At the end of eight
miles, Ford was trailing Winton, but then the &ldquo;Bullet&rdquo;
began to sputter, and it limped to the finish line behind
the racer built by Ford. The newspapers the next day
reported that Henry Ford was now in the first rank of
American &ldquo;chauffeurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November, 1901, the Henry Ford Company was
organized to manufacture automobiles, but the venture
was short-lived, and four months later, Ford was working
for himself again. In his small workshop, he went to work
on two new racers, the &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; and the &ldquo;999.&rdquo; With the
help of a draftsman, a mechanic, and a retired bicycle
champion, the new cars were made ready for racing.</p>
<p>Ford found a bicycle champion, Barney Oldfield, to
pilot his &ldquo;999&rdquo; in the Manufacturers Challenge Cup Race
at Grosse Pointe. This time his car led the field to a new
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
record, finishing a mile in front of his competitors.</p>
<p>After the race, A. Y. Malcomson, a Detroit coal
dealer, became interested in Henry Ford and his automobiles.
The two men became partners in a new venture and
Henry Ford began work on a &ldquo;pilot model&rdquo; for a new car.
During the early months of 1903, more investors were
found. By spring, a new company was organized to carry
out the plans of Ford and Malcomson.</p>
<p>In June, 1903, the Ford Motor Company was
incorporated. In addition to Malcomson, the original
stockholders included James Couzens, an employee of
Malcomson; John and Horace Dodge, the owners of a
machine shop; Albert Strelow, a contractor; John S. Gray,
a banker; Vernon E. Fry, a real estate dealer; Charles H.
Bennett, an air rifle manufacturer; C. J. Woodhall, a
clerk; Horace H. Rackham and John W. Anderson,
lawyers; and Henry Ford. Together, they had raised
$28,000 to start the new venture.</p>
<p>The new company rented a building on Mack Avenue
in Detroit for $75 a month and prepared to manufacture
its automobiles. The new factory was 250 feet long by
50 feet wide. This was adequate space, since the new
company did not attempt to make any of the parts for
its cars. The Dodge brothers, who owned a large machine
shop, made the Ford chassis, a carriage company built
the body, and the wheels were purchased in Lansing. Once
the parts were brought together, a dozen men assembled,
adjusted, and tested the completed car&mdash;the early model A
Ford. Soon this car, which sold for $950 f.o.b. Detroit,
was advertised as the &ldquo;boss of the road.&rdquo; Its two cylinders
gave it a maximum speed of thirty miles per hour.</p>
<p>Although Henry Ford&rsquo;s first two ventures into automobile
manufacturing had not been successful, this third
attempt showed great promise. At the end of the first
year, the Ford Motor Company had sold over seventeen
hundred automobiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The year 1903, which marked a turning point in the
life of Henry Ford, now forty years of age, was an interesting
year for all Americans. The first successful transcontinental
automobile trip was completed in August. A
telegraphic cable was completed across the Pacific to
Manila in the Philippines. In Washington, Theodore
Roosevelt was clearing the way for the building of the
Panama Canal, and in New Jersey, the Edison studios
completed the first full-length motion picture, called
&ldquo;The Great Train Robbery.&rdquo; Finally, in December,
Orville and Wilbur Wright flew an airplane successfully
at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. During the next few
years, those who marveled at progress in 1903 saw even
greater changes in their way of living brought about by
improved transportation and communication. The twentieth
century had started off well.</p>
<p>The Ford Motor Company was also experimenting
with changes. Models B, C, and F appeared. When the
Mack Avenue plant was no longer adequate to house the
activities of the company, a new building was erected,
ten times larger than the first one. By 1906, the company
announced models N, S, and R, as well as a six-cylinder K.
Experimentation went beyond the building of different
models of automobiles; for example, a tractor was planned
and constructed, but never sold.</p>
<p>During this time, changes were also made in the
ownership of the plant. Some of the stockholders sold out,
and Henry Ford became the major owner of the Ford
Motor Company.</p>
<p>A real danger to Ford and his company during these
early years was the threat of a patent suit. Back at the
time of the <i>Times-Herald</i> race in 1895, George Selden, a
lawyer in Rochester, New York, had patented a &ldquo;self-propelled
vehicle driven by an internal combustion
engine.&rdquo; Although he never built an automobile, all those
who did were threatened with infringement suits. This
fact made it necessary for the makers of automobiles to
pay royalties to the patent holder. The Ford Motor Company
refused. The result was a long and involved battle
in the federal courts, lasting until 1911 when the case was
finally settled in favor of the Ford Motor Company.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">The Model T is Born</span></h2>
<p>In spite of experimentation, reorganization, and
patent difficulties, the year 1907 found the Ford Motor
Company operating successfully. This was a year of panic
in the nation, but the company made plans to build an
even bigger factory to manufacture automobiles. In 1908,
it was announced that the Ford Motor Company had
purchased a race track in nearby Highland Park where it
would construct the largest automobile plant in the world.
At the same time, draftsmen and engineers were planning
a new model, to be called model T. In October, 1908, the
first model T appeared, and before the year ended, over
three hundred of them had been shipped to dealers
throughout the nation. The Ford company claimed that
this new automobile &ldquo;would sound the death knell of high
prices and big profits.&rdquo; Its advertisements announced that
&ldquo;we can devote all our time and money to taking care of
the orders for the car that people have actually been
waiting for&mdash;a family car at an honest price.&rdquo; The engine
was new and &ldquo;get-at-able,&rdquo; an important feature in a day
when most automobile owners repaired their own cars.</p>
<p>While Henry Ford had been a prominent automobile
manufacturer before 1908, it was this new &ldquo;universal&rdquo;
car that brought a new era in America. The automobile
was no longer intended for sportsmen alone, but for all
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
those who could afford to buy one, and Henry Ford intended
to see that the price of his automobile was low
enough for millions of people to own a Ford car.</p>
<p>Soon after the success of the model T was assured,
Henry Ford was asked about the secret of his ability to
produce automobiles. He divulged his &ldquo;secret&rdquo; in these
terms: have a simple design, use the latest machinery,
standardize the parts, make the entire automobile yourself,
and always have a good supply of materials on hand.
Throughout the rest of his life, he held to these principles.</p>
<p>By 1911, Ford cars were manufactured by the
hundreds of thousands. The process of assembling automobiles
received more and more attention, and by 1914,
a Ford car could be put together in an hour and a half.
By the end of 1915, a million model T&rsquo;s had been produced.
It had taken seven years to make this many of
them, but in the next eleven years, fourteen million more
were placed on the market. The model T Ford was the
&ldquo;universal car&rdquo; in fact as well as in name.</p>
<p>While model T&rsquo;s changed in appearance from year to
year, there was an even greater and never-ending change
in the process of manufacturing them. The resulting
economies brought lower prices, and this meant more
cars for more people.</p>
<p>Henry Ford was ever on the lookout for ways and
means to produce cars more efficiently. By 1914, a floor
conveyor was in operation at the Highland Park plant, so
that the half-completed cars moved through the plant
while the workers stayed in one place. This assembly line
became the key to greater production. In order to keep
the line moving smoothly, machinery was continually
being rearranged and new chutes and conveyors were
installed. Each improvement brought new and often
unforeseen problems in the never-ending task of fitting
together the pieces of the huge jig-saw puzzle of production.</p>
<p>Although the Ford Motor Company did not manufacture
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the parts that were used in assembling the first
Ford, this policy was changed through the years. More
and more of the model T was made by the company in its
own plant. In 1915, Henry Ford sent an agent out to
Dearborn to buy farm land along the River Rouge&mdash;thousands
of acres were purchased. Now there would be
room not only to enlarge the assembly line itself, but
to manufacture more of the Ford in one factory. Here it
would be possible to begin with raw materials&mdash;iron ore,
sand, cotton, rubber, and the countless other materials&mdash;and
convert them into steel, glass, and cloth to make the
Ford. With this in view, a tremendous program of construction
was begun along the banks of the River Rouge.</p>
<p>Soon there were industries within industries at the
Rouge. Blast furnaces and coke ovens were fed with coal,
iron ore, and limestone brought to the plant from Ford
mines by Ford railroads and Ford freighters. There were
glass mills, paper factories, tire plants, and saw mills.
The products of these mills and plants flowed into the
assembly lines not only at the Rouge plant but at other
assembly plants scattered all over the world.</p>
<p>The production of Ford cars rose to gigantic proportions.
In 1914, the year that Henry Ford and his engineers
began to plan for the plant on the Rouge, over two
hundred thousand automobiles were produced. But in the
year 1923, over two million model T&rsquo;s rolled off the
assembly lines. In 1925, nearly ten thousand Fords were
completed in a single day in Ford plants. The world had
never before seen such an industrial giant as the one
Henry Ford and his son Edsel had created.</p>
<p>The automobiles produced by Ford and his competitors
did more than replace the horse and carriage. They
changed the daily habits of Americans everywhere.</p>
<p>No longer did families in the cities have to live in
the shadow of the factories where the head of the household
was employed. Some families moved to the &ldquo;suburbs&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
many miles away from stores and industries, while other
city dwellers left the urban areas completely to live in the
country. On the other hand, those who had always lived
on farms could come to the city with ease in automobiles.
The farmers were able to enjoy the advantages of the
city. Thus it was that Americans moved about in a way
unheard of years before.</p>
<p>As travel increased, dirt roads were replaced by the
super-highways. Service stations, motels, and garages
dotted the newly-built concrete and brick roads. In the
cities, people became aware of the &ldquo;parking&rdquo; problem, and
of &ldquo;traffic jams.&rdquo; The increasing number of automobiles
also brought death on the highways and city streets to
hundreds of Americans each year.</p>
<p>As the years went by, automobile manufacturers
changed too. At first, there were dozens of makers of
automobiles whose names are all but forgotten now. As
the number of manufacturers decreased, the number of
cars made annually by the remaining companies grew
larger and larger. Eventually people talked about the
&ldquo;big three&rdquo; of the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Competition between rival makers and Henry Ford
brought the days of the model T to an end. From 1908 to
1927, fifteen million Fords had been produced, the Ford
Motor Company had become the colossus of the industry,
and Henry Ford&rsquo;s name was known all over the world.
Nevertheless, in order to maintain this position, it was
necessary to keep pace with the times. In order to do this,
the Rouge plant was silenced until a &ldquo;new&rdquo; Ford could
be designed and put into production. Machine tools had
to be replaced, and new dies and fixtures made. To
accomplish this in the largest factory in the world was a
herculean task. Industrial leaders all over the nation
watched with eager eyes for news from Henry Ford at
Dearborn. Finally, in December, 1927, the new model A
was shown to the public. This new Ford was front page
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
news over the nation. At the Madison Square Garden in
New York City, attendance records were broken when
crowds came to see the model A.</p>
<p>This new Ford bore little resemblance to the model T.
It now had a gear shift, four-wheel brakes, and a foot
throttle. It offered many variations in body styles and
color, and it was the first automobile to have a safety-glass
windshield.</p>
<p>The River Rouge plant once again hummed with
activity. Thousands of model A&rsquo;s were produced each
day. By 1932, five million of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Fords were on
the highways of the nation. That year, the Ford Motor
Company introduced the V-8 engine, which was unique
in its field.</p>
<p>The transition from the gas-pipe cylinder on the
kitchen sink back at 58 Bagley Avenue in the 1890&rsquo;s to
powerful eight-cylinder engines that were turned out by
the thousands each day at the largest industrial plant in
the world had taken a long time to accomplish. During
these decades, Henry Ford relentlessly pursued his idea&mdash;more
cars for more people.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">New Fields Beckon</span></h2>
<p>Automobiles, however, were not the only thing that
interested the man who put America on wheels. He had
many other ideas, some of which failed while others
succeeded.</p>
<p>There was, first, the matter of his interest in farming,
and in the land. He had experimented with a gasoline
farm tractor early in the 1900&rsquo;s, but he was unsuccessful
in developing a line of farm engines. In 1915, a tractor
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
plant at Dearborn was begun. Some of the first tractors
were sent to British farmers during the first World War.
Out of this experience grew the Fordson tractor, which,
like the model T, was light in weight and had a low selling
price. Much more important to the farmers than his
tractors was the effect that the model T Ford car had on
the life of the people in rural areas. It had, in fact, been
called &ldquo;the farmers&rsquo; car.&rdquo; Eventually Henry Ford became
interested in farming itself. He had thousands of acres
put under cultivation on Ford farms. In the 1930&rsquo;s, with
the world burdened under an economic depression, Ford
revived his interest in a program which he had begun
in 1919 of establishing small factories in the rural areas
of Michigan. He hoped to reverse the tide that saw
farmers rushing to become city dwellers, thereby bringing
about a decline of agricultural areas. He also became
interested in the products of the soil that could be used
in the making of automobiles. The agricultural laboratories
he established discovered many substitutes for metals,
and Ford cars began to appear with parts made from
soybeans and other agricultural crops.</p>
<p>He also had an idea about transportation in the air.
The idea ranged from &ldquo;flivver planes&rdquo; to all-metal three-motored
transport ships. The Ford &ldquo;tri-motor&rdquo; played an
important part in the development of commercial aviation.
Pilots called it the &ldquo;tin goose,&rdquo; and it became known
far and wide as a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; airplane in a day when flying
was hazardous. Aviation safety was also aided when a
radio beacon system was first perfected at Dearborn. Then
for a period of years, Ford dropped the manufacture of
airplanes, but in 1941, with the coming of World War II,
airplane production became a necessary part of war
preparation, and Henry Ford made airplanes again. This
time they were faster, bigger, and more deadly. Bombers
moved down the assembly lines at the Willow Run plant,
which was the &ldquo;Rouge&rdquo; of the bomber industry. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
the war ended and production was halted, over eight
thousand &ldquo;Liberators&rdquo; had been assembled by the
Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>Henry Ford watched over the assembly line at Willow
Run just as he did at the Rouge. He continued to learn
from tools and machines and to &ldquo;read&rdquo; the story they had
to tell. Out of his own experiences came his ideas about
education. In speaking of his youth, he once said, &ldquo;I was
studying all the time, not only from books but also
from things.&rdquo; In 1929 he put his ideas into practice by
establishing a combined school and museum, which he
called The Edison Institute.</p>
<p>Here he brought the schoolhouses, the dwellings, the
workshops, and the stores of other days so that the pupils
in the schools of the Institute could study not only from
books but from things. This part of the Institute he called
Greenfield Village. He gathered thousands of objects to
put into The Henry Ford Museum so that they could be
studied by all who wanted to learn about the past. &ldquo;I am
collecting the history of our people as written into things
their hands made and used,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;... a piece of
machinery or anything that is made is like a book, if you
can read it. It is part of man&rsquo;s spirit.&rdquo; He thus provided
a school not only for children but also for workers. Henry
Ford once called the museum and Village that he had
created &ldquo;a people&rsquo;s university.&rdquo; Here at The Edison
Institute the creator of mass production methods&mdash;now
intensely interested in the hand work of village craftsmen&mdash;spent
many hours. He continued to be keenly
interested in the future of the automobile industry while
he collected relics of the past. His unusual appreciation
of both the past and the future is illustrated by the
description of Henry Ford as the one man who could
spend his time collecting old churns while he followed the
experiments of his chemists concerning synthetic milk.</p>
<p>From his home in Dearborn, he kept a watchful eye
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
over the Rouge plant, now headed by his grandson, and
over The Edison Institute. It was after a visit to Greenfield
Village on the afternoon of April 7, 1947, that
Henry Ford became ill. He died during the evening at the
age of eighty-three. This man, who had been born into
a world of horse-drawn carriages, had left a world of
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
powered wheels.</p>
<div class="box">
<p>While the entire Edison Institute stands as a
memorial to Henry Ford&rsquo;s interest in the past,
certain exhibits have a particularly close relationship
to his life and work.</p>
<p>At the Henry Ford Museum, visitors can see a
special exhibition entitled &ldquo;Henry Ford: a Personal
History.&rdquo; This display depicts the important
stages in Henry Ford&rsquo;s busy career.</p>
<p>In Greenfield Village, buildings which were
closely associated with his life include:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>The Birthplace of Henry Ford.</dt>
<dt>The Bagley Avenue workshop, where Henry Ford built his first automobile.</dt>
<dt>The Magill Jewelry Store, where, as a youth, he repaired watches and clocks.</dt>
<dt>The Scotch Settlement School and the Miller School, where Henry Ford received his formal education.</dt></dl>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
